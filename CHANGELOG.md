## [3.0.1] - 2026-01-29

### 🔧 Fixed

**Critical Fix: Configuration UI Now Works!**

- Fixed config flow menu handling to properly work with Home Assistant's API
- Menu options now correctly route to their step methods
- Simplified menu structure for better reliability
- Removed complex action-based routing that was causing issues

### Changed

### Technical Details

**What was broken in v3.0.0:**
- Menu selections weren't being handled correctly
- `user_input["action"]` pattern doesn't work with `async_show_menu`
- Home Assistant expects step methods to match menu option names

**What's fixed in v3.0.1:**
- Menu options like "lessons" directly call `async_step_lessons()`
- Each weekday has its own step method (monday → `async_step_monday()`)
- Proper Home Assistant config flow patterns followed

### Migration from v3.0.0

If you installed v3.0.0:
1. Remove integration completely
2. Clear cache: `rm -rf /config/custom_components/timetable/__pycache__/`
3. Update via HACS or reinstall
4. Restart Home Assistant
5. Add integration again
6. **Configuration UI will now work!**
